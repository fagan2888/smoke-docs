# What is the Smoke blockchain?

The Smoke blockchain is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain based on Steem, capable of over 1000 transactions per second with a block being produced every 3 seconds.

Instead of mining Smoke uses a social consensus algorithm for token allocation that rewards contributions to the network:

- Currency symbol SMOKE.
- Initial supply 42,000,000 SMOKE
- Inflation rate of 9.5% per year, reducing by 0.5% per annum until the rewards drop to 5% per annum.
- 75% of inflation to social consensus algorithm.
- 15% of inflation to stake holders.
- 10% of inflation to block producers.

Using DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) allows users free transactions and usage of the network as long as they have enough vested Smoke.
