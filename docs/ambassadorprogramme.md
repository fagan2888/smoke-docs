## Content Requirements

### Original content only

All your content must be original, including all images and writing. Only use content you have the rights to, or explicit permission to post.

Do not post duplicate or truncated content and reference any quotes you have taken from elsewhere.

### Cannabis related content matters

We all know most smoke.io users have one thing in common... Cannabis. Therefore the partner programme is intended to encourage and reward content that aligns with the goals of the network and platform.

Write about topics you love and are passionate about that are interesting, on topic, and in-depth that the reader may find useful.

Content that is not related to cannabis or cannabis related lifestyle will not be illegible for inclusion. *That includes content related to Smoke technology or the smoke.io website*

**Pro Tip:** *Come up with content ideas using [Keyword research](https://backlinko.com/keyword-research) to identify topics that have a high chance of ranking in Google and getting large amounts of traffic and use browser extensions such as [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help pick-up grammar and formatting errors easily*

### Cheating the system

Users attempting to game the ambassador programme will be subject to posts being flagged and stand to lose reputation on the platform.

- Must not bully, target or shame any person or company.
