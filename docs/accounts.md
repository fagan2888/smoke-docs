# Smoke Blockchain Accounts

Smoke Accounts consist of 4 key pairs namely:

- ```Posting Key```
- ```Active Key```
- ```Owner Key ```
- ```Memo Key```

Once you [sign up](https://smoke.io/pick_account) and get approved your Smoke account and keys will be generated with the **``username`` and ``generated secure password``**.

> **DO NOT LOSE YOUR MASTER PASSWORD & KEYS AS WE CANNOT RECOVER THEM!**
<br />
> *Make sure to store your owner key in a safe place offline*

To find your key pairs simply click `wallet` and navigate to `permissions` once signed into [Smoke.io](https://smoke.io/).

It is recommended to sign in with your posting key when using the [Smoke.io](https://smoke.io/) Dapp for general use such as posting, commenting and following users.
