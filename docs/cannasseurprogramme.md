### Cannabis related content matters

We all know most smoke.io users have one thing in common... Cannabis. Therefore the cannasseur programme is intended to encourage and reward content that aligns with the goals of the network and platform.

**Pro Tip:** *Come up with content ideas using [Keyword research](https://backlinko.com/keyword-research) to identify topics that have a high chance of ranking in Google and getting large amounts of traffic and use browser extensions such as [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help pick-up grammar and formatting errors easily*
