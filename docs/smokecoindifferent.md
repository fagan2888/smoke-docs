# What makes SMOKE coin different?

## Learn what makes SMOKE coin unique and different from every other cannabis coin out there.

The SMOKE cryptocurrency is not like other cannabis coins as it has different functionality to a store of value or transmitting money.

It is a utility coin that allows access to the network and is the backbone that runs the Smoke Network blockchain and powers important aspects of the network including content rewards for high quality content and voting rights.

The first Smoke Network DApp, [Smoke.io](https://smoke.io/), provides world class social networking features combined with the ability to earn rewards from content. A first for the global cannabis community.
