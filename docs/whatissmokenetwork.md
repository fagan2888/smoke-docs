# What is Smoke Network?

Smoke.Network is a blockchain built for the social networking needs of the cannabis community. It rewards users in cryptocurrency for creating and curating high-quality content, including images, articles, cannabis strain and dispensary reviews. SMOKE is the cryptocurrency that users receive as rewards.

Users can:  

- Post stories on the network stored on the blockchain.
- Upvote and downvote posts.
- Earn rewards for creating and curating quality content on a decentralized cannabis social network.

Smoke Network is a project based on the profound potential of blockchain technology to transform the way we interact online. Building on the technology laid out by Bitcoin, Steem and EOS it allows for content creators to earn real world rewards for their contribution to the network.
