# What is Smoke.io?

## Find out about the features of Smoke.io, the first Smoke Network DApp.

### MVP Features

Our first front-end Minimum Viable Product (MVP) DApp launched on the Smoke blockchain is the [Smoke.io](https://smoke.io/) DApp. It contains the core social media networking features and will demonstrate the ability to browse, upvote, and get paid for contributions on the network into the onsite wallet.

[Smoke.io](https://smoke.io/) functions like a regular website, but it is actually a DApp (Decentralized App) powered by the open source Smoke Network blockchain. Community developers are freely able to build their own DApps running off of the Smoke Network blockchain.

Features of the Smoke.io DApp include a streamlined user sign up page, a customizable home page feed filterable by content type, an explore page for finding and curating new content on the fly, a wallet page for managing SMOKE earned and processing withdrawals, deposits and staking, a profile page for viewing and editing profile information, as well as a basic settings page to customize your experience on the network.
